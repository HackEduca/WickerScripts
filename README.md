> **Installation:**

> Being in the same directory (working directory) as the script, run the command:

> :~# **sudo cp {script_name} /usr/local/bin**

> Replace {script_name} with the specific script file. This will make it usable anywhere in the shell environment.

> *Note: You may have to enter your UNIX password.*
